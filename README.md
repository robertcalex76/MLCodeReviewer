Machine Learning Powered Code Reviewer, details tbd

Project Idea: Machine Learning-Powered Code Reviewer
A lightweight ML-based code review assistant that analyzes code and suggests improvements based on patterns learned from open-source repositories.

Why This?
Uses Machine Learning, tying into your concentration.
Involves Java, reinforcing your current work.
Encourages frequent GitHub usage with commits, branches, PRs, and issues.
Teaches GitHub Actions for CI/CD automation.
Project Overview
ðŸ“Œ Goal: Build a tool that can analyze Java code and suggest improvements based on best practices, readability, and common bug patterns.

ðŸ”¹ Tech Stack:

Java (Spring Boot or standalone CLI tool)
GitHub Actions (for automating PR-based reviews)
OpenAI API or ML Model (for pattern recognition)
AST Parsers (e.g., JavaParser) to analyze code syntax
ðŸ”¹ Core Features:
âœ… A CLI tool that scans Java files and suggests improvements
âœ… GitHub Action that comments on PRs with detected issues
âœ… Model trained on open-source Java repositories
âœ… Issue tracking + feature requests on GitHub

ðŸ”¹ GitHub Workflow Focus:

Branching strategy: feature-xyz, bugfix-abc
Issues and PRs: Log issues for improvements, submit PRs for fixes
Automated testing & CI/CD: Run tests before merging
GitHub Releases: Versioning for different iterations
Stretch Goals (Optional)
ðŸ’¡ Integrate LLMs â€“ Use OpenAIâ€™s API to analyze the code and provide suggestions
ðŸ’¡ Plugin for IntelliJ or VS Code â€“ Real-time feedback inside the IDE
ðŸ’¡ Web UI for visualization â€“ View reports instead of reading CLI output

Next Steps
Set up the GitHub repository â€“ Add README, set goals.
Create a basic Java project â€“ Even just parsing Java files initially.
Plan milestones & use Issues/Projects on GitHub.
Implement small features â€“ Push frequently to practice GitHub workflows.
Experiment with GitHub Actions â€“ Automate static analysis on PRs.
